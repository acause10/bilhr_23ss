CMAC:

Advantage:
Fast convergence (fast learning), low MSE
Good local estimates 
Simple implementation
Computationally not costly.
Local generalization prevents overfitting.

Disadvantage:
Whole input space has to be covered in order to have good global estimates. -> more traning samples implies better inference. -> Needs lot of training data.
More weight parameters needed.
Mapping is discontinuous.

FFNN:

Advantage:
Good global estimates even if the whole input space is not covered.
Less training data needed.
Mapping continuous.

Disadvantage:
Slower training time. 
Harder to implement.
Computationally expensive.
Prone to overfitting.
