## Sync & Update
In order to update your code from your own laptop, clone this repository at first and edit in it. When doing group work, it will be better to pull it first and keep up other's work, then start your own work.

## Create new tutorial
When creating a new tutorial project, please put it under "/workspace/src", just like what we did in tutorial 2.
```
cd src
catkin_create_pkg tutorial_0 std_msgs rospy roscpp
```
