Using a static goalkeeper the robot quickly learns to shoot in one spot that results in a goal.
The submitted plot was for a goalkeeper that moves to the goal position any time a goal is scored.
Initially he misses randomly because he hasn't learned anything yet.
Then he kicks to the left of the goalkeeper and hits twice in a row.
Once the goalkeeper is in the left corner of the goal he first trys kicking further and further left.
After this results in a lot of misses he continues to explore, without kicking, as each position has resulted in a miss in the past.
With more training steps the cummulative -1 penalty per action should eventually add up to make him try kicking in different locations again, 
but training is quite slow, because it has to be done manually on the robot.

Since we used decision trees for the transition function they might not have been optimal and also introducing issues.
